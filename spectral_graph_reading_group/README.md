# Reading Group on Spectral Graph Theory

Our references are primarily:

- [Lecture Notes on Graph Partitioning, Expanders and Spectral Methods](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~luca/books/expanders-2016.pdf), by  Luca Trevisan
- [CPSC 662 / AMTH 561: Spectral Graph Theory](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/spielman/561/561schedule.html) by Daniel A. Spielman



## Resources

- **spectral_reading_group_notes.pdf**: Brief notes for the reading group. You can find the latex files in the folder **notes_source**
- Jupyter notebooks for computational examples:
  - **2-Introduction.ipynb** contains some example python code for computationally understanding Laplacian matrices. The code was based on the Julia code by Spielman.
